                        <h4>SK Methodist Tg. Rambutan (2009-2014)</h4>
                        <p> I attended SKMTR for five years, from the ages of seven to twelve. The school was a welcoming place
                            with colorful murals decorating the walls. 
                            My favorite part of the school was the library, where I spent many afternoons lost in books.   
                            The teachers were kind and supportive, always willing to help me with my studies.
                            I made many close friends at SKMTR, some of whom I still keep in touch with today.  
                            Looking back, I have fond memories of my time at SKMTR and feel grateful for the education and experiences I gained there.</p>

                        <h4>MRSM Pasir Salak (2015-2019)</h4>
                        <p> My time at Maktab Rendah Sains MARA (MRSM) was a transformative experience that shaped me into the person I am today. 
                            As a student, I spent long hours studying a rigorous STEM curriculum that challenged me to think critically and solve complex problems. 
                            I have fond memories of conducting experiments in the school's laboratories and collaborating with my classmates on group projects. 
                            I was an active participant in the school's clubs which is Taekwondo. 
                            These experiences taught me valuable leadership and teamwork skills that have served me well in my personal and professional life. </p>

                        <h4>Pre-University UNIMAS (2020-2021)</h4>
                        <p> My time at pre-university at Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) was a vastly different experience from my high school years. 
                            The academic curriculum at UNIMAS was much more rigorous and specialized, with a focus on preparing students for higher education in 
                            their respective fields of study. The coursework was challenging, and I spent long hours studying and collaborating with my classmates
                            to ensure that we were all on track. Additionally, the campus life at UNIMAS was more diverse and inclusive, 
                            with students from different cultures and backgrounds coming together to form a vibrant community. I made lifelong friendships with people who shared my passions. 
                            Overall, my time at UNIMAS was a unique and rewarding experience that prepared me well for the challenges and opportunities of higher education and beyond.</p>
